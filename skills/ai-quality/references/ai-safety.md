# AI Safety

## TL;DR

Produce a source-backed AI safety report with risk taxonomy, control coverage,
jailbreak tests, evaluation metrics, escalation policy, and residual risks.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Scope The System
- Identify use case, user groups, high-stakes status, and known harm domains. [EXPLICIT]
- Create evidence ids before recommending controls. [EXPLICIT]

### Step 2: Assess Risks
- Classify each risk using `assets/risk-taxonomy.json`. [EXPLICIT]
- Assign severity and scenario text; do not collapse critical risks into generic warnings. [EXPLICIT]

### Step 3: Map Controls
- Map every risk id to at least one control from `assets/control-policy.json`. [EXPLICIT]
- Critical risks cannot use `allow` as the only action. [EXPLICIT]

### Step 4: Test And Evaluate
- Define jailbreak tests from `assets/jailbreak-policy.json`. [EXPLICIT]
- Define evaluation metrics from `assets/evaluation-policy.json`. [EXPLICIT]
- Run `bash skills/ai-safety/scripts/check.sh` when scripts are present. [EXPLICIT]

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Evidence ids support risks, controls, tests, metrics, and escalation. [EXPLICIT]
- [ ] Every risk has at least one mapped control. [EXPLICIT]
- [ ] Jailbreak coverage exists for jailbreak or prompt-injection risk. [EXPLICIT]
- [ ] Evaluation includes unsafe recall, over-refusal, and jailbreak block rate. [EXPLICIT]
- [ ] Escalation policy has owner, channels, and criteria. [EXPLICIT]

## Deterministic DoD Assets

- `assets/safety-report-contract.json` defines the report schema and required checks. [EXPLICIT]
- `assets/risk-taxonomy.json` defines harm domains and severity values. [EXPLICIT]
- `assets/control-policy.json` defines allowed control types and actions. [EXPLICIT]
- `assets/jailbreak-policy.json` defines allowed attack types and expected actions. [EXPLICIT]
- `assets/evaluation-policy.json` defines required safety metrics. [EXPLICIT]
- `scripts/validate_ai_safety_report.py` validates fixtures offline. [EXPLICIT]

## Limits

- This skill designs and validates safety report packets offline. [EXPLICIT]
- It does not certify a live model as safe. [EXPLICIT]
- Legal, medical, financial, or emergency escalation requires human owner review. [EXPLICIT]
