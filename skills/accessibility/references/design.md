# Accessibility Design

> "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." — Tim Berners-Lee

## TL;DR

Designs or implements accessible web UI behavior before or during feature
delivery. [EXPLICIT]
Use this skill to produce component-level accessibility requirements, semantic
HTML/ARIA decisions, keyboard maps, focus rules, contrast/token requirements,
form/error behavior, and acceptance criteria. [EXPLICIT]
Use `accessibility-audit` or `accessibility-testing` when the primary task is
to discover/report violations rather than design the solution. [EXPLICIT]

## Procedure

### Step 1: Discover
- Identify the feature, component, user journey, interaction states, target
  users, device constraints, and existing design system tokens/components. [EXPLICIT]
- Capture required controls, content, validation states, dynamic updates,
  responsive behavior, motion behavior, and success/failure paths. [EXPLICIT]
- If the request is only to find violations, route to `accessibility-audit` or
  `accessibility-testing`; this skill owns accessible design and implementation
  specifications. [EXPLICIT]

### Step 2: Analyze
- Choose native HTML semantics first: buttons, links, headings, labels, fieldsets,
  lists, tables, landmarks, and form controls before custom ARIA widgets. [EXPLICIT]
- For every custom component, define name, role, value/state, keyboard model,
  focus entry/exit, pointer alternative, screen reader announcement, and disabled
  behavior. [EXPLICIT]
- Map requirements to WCAG 2.1 AA / POUR areas and note acceptance criteria for
  each relevant state. [EXPLICIT]
- Identify design-token requirements for text contrast, non-text contrast, focus
  indicators, error states, disabled states, hover/focus/active states, and color
  not being the only signal. [EXPLICIT]

### Step 3: Execute
- Produce or update accessible implementation guidance, component specs, or code
  changes when explicitly requested. [EXPLICIT]
- Include keyboard interaction tables for dialogs, tabs, accordions, menus,
  combobox/listbox patterns, disclosures, toasts/live regions, forms, and skip
  links when those patterns are in scope. [EXPLICIT]
- Define focus management: initial focus, visible focus indicator, trap/containment
  when needed, return focus, route-change focus, and no focus stealing. [EXPLICIT]
- Define content requirements: accessible names, labels, descriptions, alt text,
  error copy, status messages, plain language, and sensory-independent cues.
  [EXPLICIT]

### Step 4: Validate
- Verify the output includes component behavior, semantic/ARIA decision log,
  keyboard map, focus plan, screen reader expectations, contrast/token evidence
  or not-verified status, and acceptance criteria. [EXPLICIT]
- Validate that ARIA is not used redundantly on native controls and that
  `aria-hidden` does not hide focusable or meaningful content. [EXPLICIT]
- Provide a test matrix for automated checks, keyboard, screen reader smoke,
  contrast/non-text contrast, reduced motion, 200% zoom/reflow, and forced colors
  when relevant. [EXPLICIT]

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Native HTML is used before ARIA, and every ARIA use has a clear purpose
- [ ] Accessible name, role, value/state, and description are specified for custom controls
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA ratios for text and non-text UI states
- [ ] Forms have visible labels, programmatic labels, error messages, descriptions, and recovery flow
- [ ] Focus order, focus visibility, focus return, and route-change focus are specified
- [ ] Reduced motion, zoom/reflow, and sensory-independent cues are addressed
- [ ] Acceptance criteria and validation matrix are included

## Anti-Patterns

- ARIA overuse: adding roles to elements that are already semantic (role="button" on a button)
- Visible focus removal (`outline: none`) without replacement
- Color as the only means of conveying information
- `aria-label` that hides or contradicts visible text
- Focusable content inside `aria-hidden="true"`
- Custom widgets without a keyboard interaction model

## Related Skills

- `html-semantic` — semantic HTML is the foundation of accessibility
- `form-engineering` — accessible form patterns and validation
- `responsive-design` — responsive and accessible design overlap significantly
- `accessibility-audit` — use when the primary output is an audit report
- `accessibility-testing` — use when the primary output is test automation or manual test execution

## Usage

Example invocations:

- "/accessibility-design" — Run the full accessibility design workflow
- "accessibility design on this project" — Apply to current context


## Assumptions & Limits

- Assumes access to project artifacts (code, docs, configs) [EXPLICIT]
- Does not replace domain expert judgment for final decisions [EXPLICIT]
- If contrast ratios, runtime behavior, or assistive technology output cannot be
  verified, mark them as not verified and provide the needed evidence. [EXPLICIT]

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Empty or minimal input | Request clarification before proceeding |
| Conflicting requirements | Flag conflicts explicitly, propose resolution |
| Out-of-scope request | Redirect to appropriate skill or escalate |
