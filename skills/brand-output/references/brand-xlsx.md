# Brand XLSX / Excel Workbook Generation

## Purpose

Generate `.xlsx` artifacts that are deterministic, brand-token-compliant, and
validated as real Excel packages. The skill may write the requested XLSX
artifact, but validation must stay offline and must pass the local contract
before delivery. [CONFIG]

## Deterministic Resources

- `assets/manifest.json` declares all deterministic assets. [CÓDIGO]
- `assets/activation-policy.json` defines activation, routing, and false
  positives. [CÓDIGO]
- `assets/brand-xlsx-contract.json` defines required XLSX package parts,
  workbook features, dependency boundaries, token rules, and validator checks.
  [CÓDIGO]
- `assets/fallback-brand-config.json` defines explicit fallback tokens when no
  brand config is supplied. [CÓDIGO]
- `assets/style-token-map.json` maps brand tokens to workbook styles. [CÓDIGO]
- `assets/evidence-policy.json` defines evidence tags and report requirements.
  [CÓDIGO]
- `scripts/check.sh` validates valid and invalid XLSX fixtures offline.
  [CÓDIGO]

## When To Activate

Activate when the user asks for an Excel workbook, `.xlsx`, branded
spreadsheet, spreadsheet report, KPI dashboard, openpyxl generation, or a file
intended to open in Microsoft Excel. [CONFIG]

Do not activate for CSV-only exports, HTML pages, DOCX documents, PDFs, slide
decks, image assets, or token extraction-only tasks. Route those requests to
the appropriate document or brand skill. [CONFIG]

## Inputs

- Workbook type: report, KPI dashboard, inventory table, financial summary, or
  operational workbook.
- Title, subtitle, sheet name, headers, rows, KPI blocks, and footer needs.
- Brand config path or inline brand tokens.
- Optional caller-supplied `artifact_date`, `year`, and `domain`; do not infer
  current date/time.
- Optional wide-data and print/freeze-pane requirements.

## Brand Configuration

Search order:

1. Path passed as argument.
2. `./brand-config.json` in the working directory.
3. `references/brand/design-tokens.json` when the current repo brand applies.
4. `assets/fallback-brand-config.json` when no brand config exists.

Never read hidden user-level brand files for this skill. [CONFIG]

Required token groups:

```json
{
  "brand": { "name": "", "wordmark": "", "tagline": "" },
  "colors": { "primary": "", "black": "", "white": "", "background": "", "muted": "", "primarySoft": "" },
  "typography": { "body": "" },
  "xlsx": { "artifact_date": "", "year": "", "domain": "" }
}
```

## Output Contract

Return exactly one of these outputs:

- A saved `.xlsx` artifact path plus validation evidence.
- A plan for generating the `.xlsx` when the user asks for instructions only.

The delivered `.xlsx` must include:

- Real XLSX ZIP package structure, not HTML or CSV renamed as `.xlsx`.
- `[Content_Types].xml`, `_rels/.rels`, `docProps/core.xml`,
  `xl/workbook.xml`, `xl/_rels/workbook.xml.rels`, `xl/styles.xml`, and at
  least one `xl/worksheets/sheet*.xml`.
- Core properties with title, creator, and caller-supplied artifact date.
- Meaningful sheet names, not `Sheet1`.
- Primary tab color.
- Merged title region, header row, data rows, and footer metadata.
- Brand colors and fonts in `xl/styles.xml`.
- Freeze panes, auto filter, and bounded column widths.
- Footer metadata with wordmark, tagline, caller-supplied year, and domain.
- No unresolved `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens.
- No remote fonts, remote logos, remote images, base64 images, external
  relationships, runtime current-date calls, or random values.

## Token Rules

- Use supplied brand tokens or explicit fallback tokens only.
- Do not hardcode legacy palettes such as `#122562`, `#FFD700`, `#137DC5`, or
  `#FF7E08` unless they are explicitly supplied in the active brand config.
  [CONFIG]
- Fallback defaults are `#2563EB`, `#0F172A`, `#FFFFFF`, `#F8FAFC`,
  `#475569`, `#EFF6FF`, and `Calibri`.
- Preserve tokens in generated styles so validation can trace them.

## Validation Gate

- [ ] Brand config or fallback tokens are explicitly declared.
- [ ] Output is a real `.xlsx` package, not HTML/CSV/Markdown.
- [ ] Required XLSX ZIP parts exist.
- [ ] Core properties include caller-supplied title/date.
- [ ] Sheet names are meaningful.
- [ ] Tab color uses primary token.
- [ ] Title/footer regions are merged.
- [ ] Headers, alternating rows, and footer use deterministic branded styles.
- [ ] Freeze panes, auto filter, and bounded column widths are present.
- [ ] No unresolved placeholders.
- [ ] No remote assets, base64 images, runtime dates, or randomness.
- [ ] `bash skills/brand-xlsx/scripts/check.sh` passes.

## Assumptions And Limits

- This skill creates XLSX/Excel artifacts only; it does not build HTML pages,
  DOCX documents, PDFs, slide decks, or CSV-only exports. [CONFIG]
- `openpyxl` is a suitable implementation path when available, but the
  validation gate uses the Python standard library so CI remains deterministic.
  [CONFIG]
- Excel rendering can vary by installed fonts; fallback font must be declared.
  [INFERENCIA]

## Usage

- `/brand-xlsx "AtlasOps KPI Workbook" ./brand-config.json`
- `Generate a branded XLSX report with KPI boxes and a data table`
- `Use openpyxl to create an Excel workbook using these brand tokens`
